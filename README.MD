# sahAIam

An A.I personal assistant for the elderly, which works on the basis of phone calls using the twilio API, to make those phone calls.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your path (recommended to use ubuntu or any other linux distro :D )

`export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="./google_creds.json"
`


## How to Use

sahAIam is better recommended to run on ngrok, as it's convinient to host a local service faster your device, run it on port 8080.

```bash
  ngrok http 8080
```

Once the ngrok server is live, take the link which is generated by ngrok's service and paste it in the streams.xml file handled by twilio's TwiML(Twilio Markup Language).

```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Connect>
    <Stream url="wss://your-ngrok-app-url.app/"></Stream>
  </Connect>
  <Pause length="3600"/>
</Response>
```

Finally, start your flask's websockets server to establish connection between the twilio's phone calling service and your script to easily recieve and transmit data (voice) for personal assistance module.

```bash
python server.py
```

Sad part is that we can't make phone calls from Indian phone numbers to International number, because it's expensive af (I ain't made of gold bbg). So we'll be sending a POST request to twilio to initiate a phone call so we can start conversation with the personal assistant :)

```bash
curl -XPOST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/<ACCOUNT-SID>/Calls.json -d "Url=http://<ngrok url>/twiml" -d "To=<PHONE-NUMBER>" -d "From=<TWILIO-PHONE-NUMBER>" -u <ACCOUNT-SID>:<AUTH-TOKEN>
```
